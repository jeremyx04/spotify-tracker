## Spotify Tracker
A web app that shows a user's spotify data, including their top tracks, artists, and most recently played songs. \
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

To run the project locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/jeremyx04/spotify-tracker.git
cd spotify-tracker
npm i
npm run dev
```
Note: need to include spotify api credentials in .env for the app to work.
